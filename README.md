# ‚ö†Ô∏è Create your API key from weather API

- You need to **create your own API key** by accessing this URL [üå¶Ô∏èweather API](https://www.weatherapi.com/signup.aspx)
- After that, you can use your api_key, and you can put this into the json config below.
- You can use this API key `3a8c1f1cf26f457394342515242702` if you do not have one, but we do not guarantee if that key
  is valid at the moment you run the project, so we highly recommend you create your own API key.

# ‚öôÔ∏è Setting up

- Execute the command: `make prepare`.
- We have this JSON example, you must change the `temperature.api_key` with your weather API key credentials in the
  file: `env.json`.
  ```json
  {
    "api": {
      "port": "8085"
    },
    "grpc": {
      "port": "50055"
    },
    "grpc_client": {
      "host": "service_b:50055"
    },
    "temperature" : {
      "url": "https://api.weatherapi.com",
      "api_key": "3a8c1f1cf26f457394342515242702"
    },
    "cep": {
      "url": "https://viacep.com.br"
    },
    "zipkin": {
      "host": "zipkin_svc:9411"
    },
    "otel": {
      "host": ""
    }
  }
  ```
- Finally, you can run the command `make run`.

# üß™ Testing in Local

- After you **start** the application, you can test it.
- We are using the `:8080` port.
- We have this endpoint: `/temperature` in `POST` method to get the temperature by CEP, you can use it in localhost:
